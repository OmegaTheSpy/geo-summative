                    <p class="lead">There are seven distinct landform regions in canada but they can be categorized as shield, lowlands and highlands. The landform region in the  shield category is the Canadian Shield. It is the largest of the landform regions ,covering more than half (4’800’000km2) of Canada, and it is the oldest. The landform regions in the lowlands are Hudson's Bay-Arctic Lowlands, Great Lakes and St. Lawrence lowlands and the Interior Plains. They are categorized by being flat, no mountains and low terrain. The regions categorized as Highlands are Innuitian Mountains, Western Cordelia and Appellations (welcome to). They are categorized by not being flat and having mountains.<br> Edmonton is located in the interior plains. The interior plains stretch from the arctic ocean to the 49th parallel. During formation they were covered by shallow seas and sediment was deposited there from the rocky mountains. After millions of years the sediment compressed under the weight of the newer layers. This formed sedimentary rock. One of the layers contained coral reefs this formed much of the oil and gas that is found in alberta and saskatchewan along with other smaller pockets of minerals. </p>

It also has two types of climate, continental and maritime. This also adds more variety to the climate across the country because of the moderating effect in maritime climates. The size of the country also has an effect because as you approach the north pole it gets colder.<br> <br> For Edmonton’s climate data you can look at then graph<br> <---- </p>

When People first arrived in Canada they had to live off the land. Many of the industries Canada is known for relies on the land. This reliance on the land in Canada’s history and industries shaped what Canada is known for.</p>

                    <p class="lead">In Canada there are a variety of natural disasters, because we are such a large country. Depending on where you are you may be affected by very different natural disasters. Some of the natural disasters include earthquakes, floods, hail, wildfires, Icebergs, sea ice,  fog, landslides, avalanches, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, storm surges, droughts and  volcanoes. We are also affected by natural disasters that occur in other parts of the the world. As an example of this, during the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami in Japan tons of debris washed up on the shore of BC.<br> <br><h2>Natural Disasters in Edmonton</h2><br> However, in Alberta there is much less variety. The most common types of natural disasters are floods, thunderstorms and wildfires. There are also droughts, snowstorms and tornadoes. In edmonton there have been two floods, a tornado and seven thunderstorms since 1978.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Waste Management</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Edmonton has a state of the art waste management system. Everything Starts off at the Integrated Process and Transfer Facility where it is separated into groups for each process. At the Waste to Biofuels and Chemicals Facility 140’000 tonnes of municipal solid waste is turned in to 38 million liters of biofuel each year. The biofuel is better for the environment. The Organics Processing Program (composting) takes 160’000 tonnes of organic material and turns it into compost. The Materials Recovery Facility can process 70’000 tonnes of recyclable materials per year. The recyclable materials are gathered from homes and apartments via the blue bag(for houses)  and blue bin (for larger buildings)  system.  These three facilities divert more than 50% of Edmonton’s waste from landfills. The remaining waste is put into landfills but it does not just sit there, the city of Edmonton uses a gas recovery method to harness the power of the methane and carbon dioxide. The power generated from this method is used to power 4’500 houses (1% of the total households) yearly.<br> <br> Why Is This Important?<br>Waste management is important because Canada wants to preserve its environment, as stated previously Canada cares a lot about about its environment as it has shaped its identity. Having a good environment can also improve the health of people living there.</p>
